The CDC Data Reconciliation project, known as ACCURATE (Automated Case Count Utilizing Reconciliation And Tracking Engine), aims to streamline and automate the data reconciliation process between State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial (STLT) public health information systems (PHIS) and the CDC’s Message Validation, Processing, and Provisioning System (MVPS). Currently, the annual reconciliation process is cumbersome and time-consuming, taking up to five months and hindering public health officials' ability to resolve discrepancies and make informed decisions. ACCURATE seeks to replace this manual process with an automated tool that integrates directly with MVPS, enabling more frequent and efficient data comparison.


ACCURATE will provide several key benefits, including saving time by automating comparison tasks, reducing errors in data reconciliation, and providing a consistent and transparent framework for aligning STLT and CDC data. The tool will feature direct API connections with MVPS, allowing for near real-time data discovery and synchronization, as well as the ability to schedule and generate exportable reconciliation reports. It will also guide users in resolving discrepancies with clear feedback mechanisms and track reconciliation progress to support audits and reporting. Additionally, ACCURATE will offer flexible deployment models, open-source availability on the CDC GitHub, and utilize the USWDS for accessibility and a familiar look and feel.


The project is planned in phases, with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) targeted for April/May 2025. The MVP will include foundational features for ingestion, comparisons, reporting, and reconciliation, with deployment options supporting AWS, Azure, and installation on end-user workstations. Future phases will add enhanced functionality like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), error handling, advanced reports, increased automation with AI enhancements, and additional system integrations. The goal is to provide a reliable, secure, and user-friendly system that improves the speed and accuracy of public health data reconciliation.
