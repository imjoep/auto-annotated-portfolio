The Access Connect Data Connect (ACDC) project aims to democratize data access for DoD, USAF, PEO-BES, and CDO stakeholders by exposing Data APIs currently locked behind monolithic applications. The project involves developing an enterprise data fabric that allows application teams within the DAF ecosystem to utilize and be supported by ACDC services. Key aspects include managing the API lifecycle, maintaining ACDC knowledge graphs, providing self-service modules, ensuring secure data access controls with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and offering training documentation.


ACDC is a cloud-native application built on AWS, designed to be a central, searchable repository of available APIs, enhancing discoverability, promoting reuse, streamlining onboarding, and improving governance. The platform uses Docker Compose for local development, managing services like the ACDC Dashboard web application (Next.js), Keycloak for authentication, and the Tyk stack for API management. The ACDC web application facilitates a user workflow where Data Owners create and manage API proxies, and Data Consumers browse the catalog and request access.


The ACDC project also involves specific initiatives, such as the ACDC integration with A4 systems. This project focused on establishing collaboration with the A4 technical team, supporting their proof-of-concept (POC) API integration needs, and demonstrating ACDC's functional capabilities in a test environment using dummy data. The project highlighted ACDC's potential to streamline API integration processes and employed a user-centered design approach to refine the ACDC catalog. Recommendations for A4 included documenting their data architecture, adopting an API Platform Maturity Model, and piloting a "Data as a Product" approach.
