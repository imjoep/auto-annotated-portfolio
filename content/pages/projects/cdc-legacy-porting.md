The Legacy Data Porting project focuses on migrating historical data from older, "legacy" systems into newer, standardized platforms, specifically within the context of public health data and the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NBS). The core challenge is that NBS users implementing new condition investigation pages built with page builders need a way to transfer and combine historical data with newly collected data. Without this capability, users face excessive time spent on manual data manipulation, hindering their ability to analyze comprehensive data and make informed decisions for public health improvements. This project aims to address the issues arising from data structure and format incompatibilities, limited automation in mapping and validation, error management and resolution, and the lack of standardized data governance in the legacy data porting process.


The research conducted for the project reveals several key pain points and opportunities. Users experience extensive delays and back-and-forth communication due to the complexity of mapping data between legacy and new systems. Manual processes are prevalent, leading to errors that are difficult to recover from, often requiring users to restart the entire process. There is also a lack of clear, documented procedures and knowledge transfer, which becomes particularly problematic when experienced IT staff leave. The project identifies key personas, such as NBS users who are epidemiologists or data managers, and database administrators who handle the technical aspects of data migration, each with specific needs and challenges in the data porting process.


Technical considerations for the Legacy Data Porting project include leveraging existing NBS environments in AWS, ensuring flexible deployment options across different cloud platforms, and maintaining security by aligning with existing Authorization to Operate (ATO) frameworks. The project aims to streamline the data porting process by automating comparisons, reducing errors, and providing a consistent framework for aligning data between different systems. The goal is to create a more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly system that allows for seamless data migration and integration, ultimately improving the speed and accuracy of public health data analysis.
