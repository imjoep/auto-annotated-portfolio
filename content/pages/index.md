      Graduating from the University of Nebraska at Omaha with a degree in
      **Management Information Systems** (MIS) set the trajectory for my career.


      After graduation, I moved to Houston and worked as a **Developer /
      Business Analyst** for *Aon Hewitt* (a Fortune 500 company) in the
      \***financial** \*and ***benefits outsourcing*** career field.  After 4.5
      years, we decided to move back to Nebraska.


      Wanting to try my hand at a more technical role, I took a job at *ACI
      Worldwide* as a **Systems Engineer** in the ***financial** industry
      setting up the infrastructure for their Point of Sale systems*.\*\*  I
      learned quickly that I enjoyed the business side of things more and my
      wife and I decided to move to Austin, TX after less than a year.


      My first role down in Austin was for *W2O Group* \*\*\*\*(a smaller
      agency) as a **Solution Manager**.  For W2O, I acted as the liaison
      between the customers, the UX team, the developers, and senior leaders at
      the company.  We built multiple websites and mobile applications for
      MasterCard, numerous pharmaceutical companies, and universities.


      From W2O, I moved over to *NIC Inc./Texas.gov* as a **Scrum Master /
      Product Owner**.  We managed the Texas.gov website and modernized the
      vehicle inspection process as well as the private security license
      process.  With millions of vehicle inspections per year, we focused
      heavily on minimizing user interactions, thus speeding up the entire
      process.  For private security, we took a process that averaged 6 months
      to get a license, and reduced it to 2 weeks.  NIC focused on ***state
      government***.  We lost the contract renewal to Deloitte, who was able to
      undercut us.


      I then became a **Product Manager** at *IBM* building a hybrid cloud
      storefront.  Working with business development teams and customers to help
      define requirements, working with User Experience (UX) to design it,
      working with developers to build it, and then working with automated
      Quality Assurance (QA) to test it.


      Post **IBM** I pursued an opportunity at *The Home Depot* as an
      **Internal** **Product Manager**.  Leading an initiative to get Kubernetes
      deployed into the back of every retail store, leading to more efficient
      modernization of infrastructure and applications running on store
      hardware.  This was my first experience in ***retail***.  We successfully
      deployed K8s to the back of every store in North America and Canada.  


      I then had an opportunity to work for our ***federal government*** with
      *Omni Federal* (a smaller consulting agency) as a **Program Manager**. 
      While at Omni, I honed my skills in financial management, resource
      management, license management, product management, and project
      management.
